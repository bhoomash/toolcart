# 🔐 SECURITY NOTICE - Sensitive Credentials Removed

## ⚠️ **CRITICAL SECURITY UPDATE**

All sensitive credentials have been removed from version control to prevent security breaches.

## 🛡️ **What Was Secured:**

- ✅ Database connection strings (MongoDB Atlas credentials)
- ✅ Email account credentials  
- ✅ JWT secret keys
- ✅ Razorpay API keys and webhook secrets
- ✅ Hardcoded fallback credentials in source code

## 🔧 **Setup Instructions:**

### **Backend Setup:**
1. Copy environment template:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Fill in your actual credentials in `backend/.env`:
   - See `backend/ENV_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions

### **Frontend Setup:**
1. Copy environment template:
   ```bash
   cd frontend  
   cp .env.example .env.development
   ```

2. Set your actual values in `frontend/.env.development`

## 🚨 **NEVER COMMIT:**

The following files should NEVER be committed to version control:
- `backend/.env`
- `frontend/.env.local`
- Any file containing real credentials
- Private keys, certificates, or tokens

## 🔒 **Production Deployment:**

For production environments:
1. Set environment variables in your hosting platform (Vercel, etc.)
2. Never use development/test credentials in production
3. Rotate secrets regularly
4. Monitor for credential exposure

## 📞 **If Credentials Were Exposed:**

If any real credentials were previously committed:
1. **IMMEDIATELY** rotate all exposed credentials
2. Generate new API keys
3. Change database passwords
4. Update JWT secrets
5. Review access logs for unauthorized usage

## 🔍 **Security Best Practices:**

- Use strong, unique passwords
- Enable 2FA on all accounts
- Regularly audit and rotate credentials
- Use environment-specific credentials
- Monitor for suspicious activity
- Keep dependencies updated
